*When the application is launched, the user will need to input a name for their player's display name. Once a user has typed and submitted a display name, they are greeted with two buttons, host and join. The host button allows the player to generate the game's object and add the object to the list of games. Once the game has been created, the passcode is displayed and the player will have to give the code to any other player, which they will need to type it out in the input box after they clicked on the join button to join the host player's private game. If both players are present, the host player can begin the game by clicking on the button below.*
